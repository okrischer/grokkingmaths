# Prime Numbers
A natural number is called a *prime number* (or a *prime*) if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers.
The numbers that are not prime are called *composite numbers*.
In other words, $n$ is prime if $n$ items cannot be divided up into smaller equal-size groups of more than one item.

Let's illustrate this for the prime number 7 with [Cuisenaire rods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisenaire_rods):

There are *infinitely many* prime numbers.
This statement is referred to as *Euclid's theorem* in honor of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, who offered the proof in his work Elements (Book IX, Proposition 20):

!!! danger "Euclid's Theorem"
	Consider any finite list of prime numbers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$.\
	Let $P$ be the product of all the prime numbers in the list: $P = \prod_{k=1}^n = p_1 * p_2 * \dots * p_n$.\
	Let $q = P + 1$. Then $q$ is either prime or not:

	- If $q$ is prime, then there is at least one more prime that is not in the list, namely, $q$ itself.
	- If $q$ is not prime, then some prime factor $p$ divides $q$. If this factor $p$ were in our list, then it would divide $P$ (since $P$ is the product of every number in the list); but $p$ also divides $P + 1 = q$, as just stated. If $p$ divides $P$ and also $q$, then $p$ must also divide the difference of the two numbers, which is $(P + 1) − P$ or just 1. Since no prime number divides 1, $p$ cannot be in the list.
	This means that at least one more prime number exists beyond those in the list.

We can test whether a number is prime by *trial division*:
given an input number $n$, check whether it is divisible by any number between 2 and $\sqrt{n}$ (i.e., whether the division leaves no remainder).
If so, then $n$ is *composite*.
Otherwise, it is *prime*.\
For any divisor $p \geq \sqrt{n}$ there must be another divisor $q = \frac{n}{p} \textrm{ with } q^2 \leq n$, and therefore looking for divisors up to $\sqrt{n}$ is sufficient.
This insight leads to the following definition of prime numbers:

!!! warning "Definition of Primes"
	A natural number $n$ is **prime** if $n > 1$ and no number $p$ with $p^2 \leq n$ divides $n$. More formally

	$P(n) \equiv n \in \mathbb{N} \land n > 1 \land \forall p((p > 1 \land p^2 \leq n) \Rightarrow \neg p|n).$

Translating that definition into an algorithm, we check only for the number 2 and every subsequent odd number as divisors:

But we can do better, using the *Sieve of Eratosthenes*, which is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.\
It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number.
Once all the multiples of each discovered prime have been marked as composites, the remaining unmarked numbers are primes.

Furthermore, since the inner loop is executed for prime numbers only, the
running time is even less: it can be shown that the actual running time for the
*sieve of Eratosthenes* is $\mathcal{O}(n \log \log n)$.
Not bad for an ancient algorithm.

## Prime Factorization

In number theory, *integer factorization* is the decomposition of a positive integer into a product of integers.
If one of the factors is composite, it can in turn be written as a product of smaller factors, for example $12 = 4 \times 3 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 2^2 \times 3$.
Continuing this process until every factor is prime is called *prime factorization*. 
The result is always unique up to the order of the factors by the *fundamental theorem of arithmetic*.

!!! danger "Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic"
	Every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.

For example, $360 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot5$.
The theorem says two things about this example: first, that 360 can be represented as a product of primes, and second, that no matter how this is done, there will always be exactly three $2$s, two $3$s, one $5$, and no other primes in the product.

The requirement that the factors be prime is necessary: factorizations containing composite numbers may not be unique (for example, $12 = 3 \times 4 = 2 \times 6$).\
The existence of a unique prime factorization for every integer number makes it relatively easy to compute the number's prime factors.
The key idea of such an algorithm is:
*instead of just checking if a number divides $n$, actually divide $n$ by this number*.

The algorithm works as follows:\
for each integer number $k \geq 2$, if $k$ is a factor of $n$, divide $n$ by $k$
and completely divide out each $k$ before moving to the next $k$.
When the next $k$ is a factor it will necessarily be prime, as all smaller factors
have already been removed.
After dividing out all prime factors $n$ will equal to 1.

3. stop if all factors have been divided out

## Prime Number Theorem
There are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by *Euclid* around 300 BC.
No known simple formula separates prime numbers from composite numbers.
However, the distribution of primes within the natural numbers in the large can be
statistically modelled.

!!! danger "Prime Number Theorem"
	The probability of a randomly chosen large number being prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, that is, to its logarithm.
	This can be denoted with *asymptotic notation*:

	$\pi(n) \sim \frac{n}{\ln{n}},$

	where $\pi(n)$ is the prime-counting function.

The $\sim$ in the formula reads as "*is similar to*" and means that the ratio
of $\pi(n)$ to the right-hand fraction approaches 1 as $n$ grows to infinity.

Let's check that formula for a small $n=1000$ with our `sieve` function for
generating primes:

Note quite there, but that's not a surprise.\
Considering the *sieve of Eratosthenes* again, we see that starting with 2, every subsequent
second number is crossed out (not prime), then every third and fifth number, and so forth.
The further we move upwards, the more numbers have already been crossed out, making it
less likely to hit a prime.
Thus, for a small $n$ we're getting actually more primes than suggested by the prime number theorem.

Let's calculate the values of $\pi(n)$, using `sieve` as the generating function

!!! hint "Solution"
	The problem is that we don't know in advance with which value we should call the `sieve` function, that is, up to which number potential primes should be created.
	Of course, we could find that limit with *trial and error*, but since this is a course in mathematics, we should try to get a more reasonable answer.

	Using the prime number theorem $\pi(n) \sim \frac{n}{\ln n}$, we can set $\pi(n)$ to $10001$, and as we know that the number of primes per constant interval decreases with growing $n$, we can write this as the inequality $10001 \geq \frac{n}{\ln n}$.

	Making some educated guesses for $n$, we can check if this inequality holds:
	- a) $90000 \div \ln{90000} \approx 7889$
	- b) $105000 \div ln{105000} \approx 9081$
	- c) $120000 \div ln{120000} \approx 10260$

	We set $n = 105000$ (b), the biggest value for which $\frac{n}{\ln n} \leq 10001$:
	
	```julia
	function solveSieve(n::Int)
		sieve(105_000)[n]
	end
